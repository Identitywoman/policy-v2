<p>Technology has transformed how the private sector operatesâ€”and revolutionized the efficiency, convenience, and effectiveness with which it serves its customers. The Federal Government has largely missed out on that transformation due to poor management of technology investments, with projects too often costing hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, taking years longer than necessary to deploy, and delivering technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed. </p>

<p>The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) is part of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within the Executive Office of the President.  We provide direction to agencies in the use of technology to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation. We are working to close the gap between the public and private sector on technology and innovation.</p>

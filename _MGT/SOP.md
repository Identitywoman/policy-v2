### Mission of the Technology Modernization Fund ###
<i> Operate the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) to enable agencies to reimagine and transform the way they use technology to deliver their mission and services to the American public in an effective, efficient, and secure manner </i>

### Guiding Principles ###
As voting members of the Technology Modernization Board, we stand by the following guiding principles to achieve the mission of the TMF:

#### Serve the best interest of the American public ####
<ul>
<li>Prioritize technology solutions to improve delivery of mission-critical services </li>
<li>Prioritize projects than can serve as common solutions and/or inspire reuse </li>

</ul>

#### Abide by an open, transparent, and fair process for evaluating project proposals ####
<ul>
<li> Implement a fair evaluation process based on consistent criteria that includes a strong technical and security approach with an execution strategy led by a highly capable team </li>
<li> Require agencies to articulate why they are requesting funds from the TMF and provide assurance of sound project cost and savings estimates </li>
<li> Accept proposals for both types of projects:
<ul>
<li> New projects or ideas that require funding to get off the ground </li>
<li> Ongoing projects that need an input of funds or technical expertise to improve project execution and drive stronger results </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Publish updates, success stories, funding recommendations, and additional information that allows agencies to learn from the TMF operating model </li>
<li> Operate without a perception of bias and make funding recommendations based on the merits of individual proposals </li>
</ul>

#### Develop an agile project implementation process that supports the mission of the Fund ####
<ul>
<li> Implement a multi-step application process to guarantee a variety of projects are considered and the Board has all information needed to make informed funding recommendations 
<ul>
 <li>Step 1: Intake Initial Project Proposals based on Board-approved template</li>
 <li>Step 2: Work with agency sponsors who have a project that meets the acceptable threshold of evidentiary support established by the Board in order to develop a strong business case and have project leadership present their vision and execution strategy to the Board for funding recommendations</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
<li> Ensure, to the extent practicable, that technical expertise, sound project management leadership, and other necessary resources are available to project teams </li>
</ul>
#### Promote the health, sustainability, and utility of the Fund ####
<ul>
<li> Maintain a diverse portfolio of funded projects including those at different stages of maturity, low and high risk opportunities, and projects from different agencies </li>
<li> Establish milestones to ensure projects are on schedule and most likely to succeed </li>
<li> Assess Board and Fund performance on a regular basis to continuously improve processes and functions in order to ensure overall portfolio health </li>

</ul>

#### Operate according to Board rules and procedures ####
<ul>
<li> Ensure all rules and procedures align to the guiding principles of the Board </li>
<li> Establish a confidential environment that encourages candid discussion and the presentation of different opinions that produces substantive debate and, ultimately, conclusive recommendations from a majority of the Board </li>
</ul>

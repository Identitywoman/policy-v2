### II. Scope

The requirements in part III, sections 1 and 2 of this Memorandum apply to all new information collection, creation, and system development efforts as well as major modernization projects that update or re-design existing information systems. National Security Systems, as defined in 40 U.S.C. ยง 11103, are exempt from the requirements of this policy. The requirements in part III, section 3 apply to management of all datasets used in an agency's information systems. Agencies are also encouraged to improve the discoverability and usability of existing datasets by making them "open" using the methods outlined in this Memorandum, prioritizing those that have already been released to the public or otherwise deemed high-value or high-demand through engagement with customers (see part III, section 3.c). Agencies should exercise judgment before publicly distributing data residing in an existing system by weighing the value of openness against the cost of making those data public.

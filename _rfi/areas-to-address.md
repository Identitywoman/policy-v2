#### A.	Questions to Consider:
Responses should address holistically Background, Functional Requirements, and comply with the Security Baseline (Appendix B, Security).  Additionally, industry feedback should provide solutions that address all aspects of collaboration as defined below.  Based on the definition, how would industry effectively address the requirements while ensuring that the solutions are interoperable across all cloud tools and comply with industry standards?  An example would be the ability for different Departments and Agencies to have the ability to collaboratively edit a document despite using different platforms, email service providers, etc.

Interoperability:  Interested providers of solutions that provide web based communications and collaboration tool services are invited to submit responses. These solutions must be universally available/accessible via a web browser on government owned, contractor owned or personally owned end user devices. 

Security:   Provide solutions to improve information sharing between agencies given potential small variations in requirements for security and different combinations of access specifications among nations. 

The federal government is interested in whole or severable (partial) solutions. The government will entertain mitigation or alternative solutions to include security and may trade some requirements for total cost reductions.

#### B.	Additional Questions to Consider and Include: 
GSA would also like to obtain feedback from industry on a potential cloud contract vehicle. 

1.	**Current Challenges:**  List what barriers you encounter in selling these services to government. Examples of potential answers: fixed budget does not allow for usage based billing, contract type, etc.
2.	**Scope of potential acquisition contract:** How would your company provide multi-tenancy support required for managing services to numerous Federal Agencies?
3.	**Flexibility:**
	a.	Given that cloud products and services are rapidly changing, what process or structure would your company propose for the acquisition contract to keep current with industry in regards to capability and pricing?
	b.	How would you suggest that awarded solutions be “updated” based on a technology change and pricing?
4.	**Acquisition Structure:** 
	a.	What would you propose as the easiest and most cost effective way for government to offer cloud email solutions to all Federal Agencies?
	b.	What has significantly changed (since the initial 2010 launch of the IaaS BPA) in the Cloud market that might impact how agencies procure cloud email and collaboration services?
5.	**Aggregated Discounts:** 
	a.	Would your company support government wide volume discounts by aggregating at the CLIN (contract line item number) level government wide? (i.e. once a certain dollar threshold is met for a CLIN, all government agencies would receive a percent volume discount). 
	b.	Explain how this would be accomplished.
6.	***Consistent Acquisition Methodology:*** Can GSA modify or change how it buys and sells cloud email services within the limitations of the FAR to be more consistent with how solutions are structured and sold commercially?
7.	**Security:** 
	a.	Are there any security prohibiting factors beyond those in Appendix B, Security, and included in the RFI that are challenges for providing a solution?  
	b.	Are there security innovations that should be included or are disallowed in current solutions?

#### General Company Information

9.	Provide the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that your company utilizes for providing cloud computing.
10.	Identify any GSA Schedule or other GSA contract with government-wide access (e.g., GWAC or BPA) on which your company currently holds an award.

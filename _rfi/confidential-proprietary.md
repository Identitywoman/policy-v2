I.	Use of Results and Confidential/Proprietary Information

1.	Any document submitted in response to this RFI that contains confidential/proprietary information must be marked on the outside as containing confidential/proprietary information. Each page upon which confidential/proprietary information appears must be marked as containing confidential/proprietary information. The confidential/proprietary information must be clearly identifiable to the reader wherever it appears. All other information will not be treated as confidential/proprietary.
2.	All information marked confidential/proprietary in RFI responses is only for the governmentâ€™s planning use. Confidential/proprietary information may be reviewed by contractors providing advisory services within scope of contract, subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), including but not limited to commercial or financial data obtained from or contained in contractor/vendor submitted documents and proposals. Otherwise, no information marked confidential/proprietary included in this document or in discussions connected to it may be disclosed to any other party outside of the government.
3.	The results of the RFI will be used to inform a GSA decision on the potential creation of a new cloud contract vehicle. The release of this RFI does not guarantee that the government will, in the end, complete an acquisition, or create a new cloud contract vehicle.

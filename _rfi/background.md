 Too few Federal workers and teams leverage modern collaboration tools like real-time shared documents, instant messaging, video conferencing, wiki-based sites for team projects, and more.  The lack of interoperable collaboration capabilities is common within Federal departments and agencies and almost even more challenging between departments and agencies or between Federal and State, local, or tribal entities.  The situation is a hidden tax on productivity; it wastes time, creates missed opportunities, and slows coordination and creativity and can even pose a challenge for recruiting and retaining employees.  The problem can be further described as follows:  

Firstly, the market for collaboration tools and infrastructure is complex, fragmented, and evolving quickly.  A plan developed last year does not necessarily make sense this year as new tools and solutions enter the market.  Secondly, requirements for collaboration tools developed within one part of the Federal Government have a certain risk posture and legal requirements that may not be compatible with other groups within the Federal Enterprise.  This can lead to solutions that do not interoperate, duplicative acquisitions, and higher contract costs.  Third, the lack of good collaboration tools and commonality between requirements can lead to an inconsistent security posture that is difficult to assess or audit.  The current environment results in users performing workarounds that undermine security.  

The current approach is neither viable nor sustainable.  Is it possible for a future Administration official to send a single email to all Federal workers?  Could Federal workers from five different Agencies collaboratively edit a document together in real-time?  Could instant messages be sent between Federal employees using mobile devices and applications from different vendors and delivered reliably and archived appropriately?  As the government migrates towards category management, cloud infrastructure, mobile technologies, and shared services, there is need to address these issues but Government will need industry innovation and ideas.  Ideally, it should be as easy to collaborate in one room face-to-face as sitting in different rooms, different agencies, and organizations.

For the purpose of this RFI, collaboration tools are segmented into two general categories, asynchronous collaboration, including email, calendaring, directory, file sync and share, enterprise content management, and secure external file sharing; and synchronous collaboration, including instant messaging, presence, audio/video/web conferencing, group messaging/chat, softphone, and collaborative document editing.  Important characteristics are listed below:

* **No training required**—best of breed and easy to acquire and use
* **Interoperable**—complements and integrates across communication modalities, functions, and vendors
* **Secure by design**— complies with relevant government standards and common baseline requirements
* **Real-time**— supports real-time editing and interactive document sharing
* **Multi-device**—integrates with mobile and works on major devices and screens.
* **Simple**— provides communication modalities appropriate for the task that works across vendors
* **Enable ad-hoc teams**— supports creation and teardown of quick ephemeral teams on a project-by-project basis 
* **Internal/external Sharing**— supports sharing between departments and agencies with appropriate security permissions and controls
* **Reduces the total cost of ownership**— provides a holistic solution that reduces operational and maintenance burden on departments and agencies

The government is committed to this roadmap for the future of Federal collaboration.

## Background on Schema
A Policy Schema is a way to organize data points on policies in a way that provides structure and clarity. Schemas also help structure policy in a way that makes it easier to understand. Imagine being able to find requirements in a 900-page document with just one click of your mouse.  Using the Policy Schema allows the government to put information into buckets.  Once this structure is created, the OFCIO can map agency requirements across policy, legislation, and regulations.  

The Policy Schema is based on the principles of a Database Schema. Traditionally, a database schema is a structure that represents a logical view of a database. The schema defines how the data is organized and the relationships within the database. It also provides constraints like how the data is named and the type of data included.  The Policy Schema does that same thing. We aim to structure policy in a way that can easily translate into a database structure.

Extensive research was conducted in order to draft the Policy Schema.  The OFCIO researched schemas that were being crafted in the legislative, regulatory, and academic sectors. A list of related projects is available here.  Additionally, experts in government data were consulted and their insights were incorporated into the Schema.  

The Policy Schema is the backbone of two major OFCIO projects to reform IT policy across the federal sector.  In order to understand the existing policies, the OFCIO set out to map and standardize Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s IT Policy.  Creating a common baseline was essential to understand what reforms were needed.

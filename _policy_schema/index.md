Hello, and welcome to the Policy Schema Website. On this site you will find information on the Federal Chief Information Officer’s efforts to build a data schema for organizing public policy.  We are calling this the “Policy Schema” and will use it to organize IT Policy both in the drafting process and when presenting information about our policies upon publication.  As the Policy Schema is developed, we invite you to comment on the model and provide us feedback.  For more information on the Policy Schema please visit our background page here. 
We have organized the content of this site to facilitate ongoing discussions.  Below is a brief description of the content that you will find in each section.
* Background on Schema
  * This section provides a broad overview of what a Data Schema is and how it relates to IT Public Policy.  We include a basic explanation of the Policy Schema and how it relates to ongoing efforts to reform OMB policies.
* Related Projects and Interoperability 
  * In this section we discuss the efforts of other organizations in this field.  During the drafting of the Policy Schema we researched federal, state, private, and academic data schemas.  You can find links to projects that influenced our thinking and helped us craft the Policy Schema.
  * This section also discusses our long-term ambition to build out the schema to map to other data schemas.  This is a long-term goal, and we will be updating this content regularly. 
* Schema Definitions  
  * The schema is really a set of attributes organized into a hierarchy of terms.  You can view the definitions of these attributes in this section.  
* Governance 
  * This section describes the governance process the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) will use to ensure that the Policy Schema stays relevant and incorporates feedback into its design.  Through a defined maturity model, we will continuously improve the model and iterate on its design.
* Example of Policy
  * Individuals more familiar with what a data schema is may find it useful to see it in an XML format.  This section provides an example of a populated schema in XML.
* Questions and Contact Information
  * If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to us.  This section provides instructions on how to contact us.

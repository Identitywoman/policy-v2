## Governance
In this section you will find information on how we plan on maturing the Policy Schema model over time.  The OFCIO recognizes the need to update the model on a regular basis.  As the Policy Schema becomes more widely used, the need to add attributes will be phased in.  
### Timeline
On a yearly basis we will refine the schema to ensure it stays relevant to government practitioners. The OFCIO will work with experts in the academic, private, and public realm. We want to develop a schema that can be used throughout the government and adopted by anyone seeking to clarify complex policy.
### Maturity Model
The schema is going to mature in phases. In order to structure how the schema will evolve over time we have adopted the Data Governance Maturity Model as a way of thinking about how to manage the schema.
1.    _Initial_- During this phase the OFCIO researches how policy is written and what standards exist in the field. This can also be considered a discovery phase, with the primary purpose to understand what policies are present in the federal sector.

2.    _Managed_- The Managed Phase begins by finding specific requirements that are in policies and populating the draft schema. Once completed, we will have the scope needed to understand how to organize the data effectively. This phase focuses on IT Policy that is issued by the OMB.

3.    _Defined_- During the Defined Phase we look at how to ensure the schema is interoperable with other standards that exist in this space. Ideally, we would map the Policy Schema’s attributes with schemas that collect data on regulations and legislation. We would also look at ways to map policies from other Federal agencies to the schema.

4.    _Quantitatively Managed_- In this phase we will develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to see how well the schema is being adopted and if business needs are being addressed.

5.    _Optimized_- Using KPIs established in the Quantitatively Managed phase, we will work on continually improving the Policy Schema.  Exact measurements haven’t been developed, but the result would mean that the Policy Schema is A) accurately defining policies; B) useful for agencies; and C) interoperable with other schemas.

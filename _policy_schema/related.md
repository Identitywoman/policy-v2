Here you will find a list of projects that we have used to shape our Policy Schema. If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment on this page. Our office is always looking for more information to refine the Policy Schema.

### [NARA Standard] (http://www.archives.gov/preservation/technical/guidelines.html)
NARA follows the guidance of the US Government Publishing Office (GPO) in the development of their standard. The GPO publishes the “Code of Federal Regulations XML Rendition” which codifies legislation into a common format.

### [USLM Standard] (http://xml.house.gov/schemas/uslm/1.0/USLM-User-Guide.pdf)
This standard’s scope specifically describes only US legislation coming out of the House of Representatives. There are an Abstract and Concrete model. The Abstract Model is more generalized and can be used to map the Policy Schema to their markdown. The Concrete Model is too specific and does not add value to the Policy Schema effort.

### [Akoma Ntoso Standard] (http://www.akomantoso.org/)
Akoma Ntoso strives to create an international standard for legislative and judiciary documents.  They curate this standard in XML format and work to incorporate the legal needs of parliamentary governments around the world.

### [State Decoded] (https://www.statedecoded.com/)
State Decoded is an open source platform that can be used to display state codes, court decisions, and information from legislative tracking services.  It works to make legal codes understandable by regular people and is widely adopted in municipal governments across the United States.

### [18F] (https://18f.gsa.gov/)
18F is an office inside the General Services Administration that helps other Federal agencies build, buy, and share efficient and easy-to-use digital services. They are a team of technology experts that work with agencies to diagnose problems and then work alongside agency teams to find the right solutions. Data schemas for 18F websites are publically available on GitHub. 18F will develop a schema as part of the service it provides to agencies.

### [Madison] (https://mymadison.io/)
Madison is a policy collaborative open source platform that provides a mechanism for individuals to comment on laws and legislation. With Madison, users can access laws as they are being written, leave comments, annotate specific content, and interact with other participants.

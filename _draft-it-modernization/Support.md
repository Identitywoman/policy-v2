Executive branch employees are encouraged to join the IT Modernization Initiative listserv by emailing listserv@listserv.gsa.gov with no subject and “subscribe it modernization” in the body (from a .gov or .mil email address only.) The listserv will help support cross-agency communication, collaboration, and sharing of best practices and lessons learned. Questions regarding implementation of this memorandum may be referred to this listserv.

In addition, GSA will collaborate with agencies to refine relevant criteria and templates and share best practices and other resources at management.cio.gov.

Questions regarding this memorandum that cannot be asked on the listserv may be referred to OMB’s Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer at ofcio@omb.eop.gov.

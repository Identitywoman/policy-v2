The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is developing a data schema to represent Federal IT policy in a machine readable format in order to create new possibilities for parsing policy and linking it to statute, agency policy, and compliance data, among other things.

The Policy Schema will also be used to inform the policy drafting process, helping OFCIO craft more carefully structured and targeted policy requirements and pair them with consistent metadata.

The Policy Schema will create a structure the government can use to organize policies and create “buckets” for related information. The schema will provide clarity and ease of use for agencies, government practitioners, and the public, making requirements and guidance contained within policies easier to access. Instead of reading through or manually searching for relevant requirements in a 900-page document, the Policy Schema will enable users to pull those requirements with a single click. Additionally, once this structure is created, the OFCIO will be able map agency requirements across policy, legislation, and regulations 

The Policy Schema is the backbone of two major OFCIO projects to reform IT policy across the federal sector.  In order to understand the existing policies, the OFCIO set out to map and standardize Office of Management and Budget’s IT Policy.  Creating a common baseline is essential to understand what reforms were needed.  

Extensive research was conducted in order to create the draft Policy Schema. The OFCIO researched schemas that were being crafted in the legislative, regulatory, and academic sectors. A list of related projects is available here. Experts in government data were also consulted and their insights were incorporated into the Schema.  

As the Policy Schema is developed, we invite you to provide feedback and comments on the model. For more information on the Policy Schema please visit our background page here.

Internationally there are a number of emerging standards that tackle similar problems to the OFCIO Policy Schema. In order to maximize interoperability, OFCIO studied these projects and adopted similar field definitions, structures, and identifiers where possible. 

This section contains information on some of the most prominent of those projects.  As these standards and the Policy Schema continue to develop, we encourage you to share your expertise and suggestions.

### NARA 
The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, in partnership with the US Government Publishing Office (GPO) is developing a data standard for the representation of federal regulations.

### USLM Standard
This standard’s scope specifically describes only legislation coming out of the U.S. House of Representatives. There are an Abstract and Concrete model. The Abstract Model is more generalized and can be used to map the Policy Schema to their markdown. The Concrete Model is too specific and does not add value to the Policy Schema effort.

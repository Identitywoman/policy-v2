Internationally there are a number of emerging standards that tackle similar problems to the OFCIO Policy Schema. In order to maximize interoperability, OFCIO studied these projects and adopted similar field definitions, structures, and identifiers where possible. 

This section contains information on some of the most prominent of those projects.  As these standards and the Policy Schema continue to develop, we encourage you to share your expertise and suggestions.

### NARA 
The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, in partnership with the US Government Publishing Office (GPO) is developing a data standard for the representation of **what**. The GPO publishes the “Code of Federal Regulations XML Rendition” which codifies legislation into a common format.

### USLM Standard
This standard’s scope specifically describes only legislation coming out of the U.S. House of Representatives. There are an Abstract and Concrete model. The Abstract Model is more generalized and can be used to map the Policy Schema to their markdown. The Concrete Model is too specific and does not add value to the Policy Schema effort.

### eRegulations Schmea
**refocus this section on eRegulations platform**
18F is an office inside the General Services Administration that helps other Federal agencies build, buy, and share efficient and easy-to-use digital services. They are a team of technology experts that work with agencies to diagnose problems and then work alongside agency teams to find the right solutions. Data schemas for 18F websites are publically available on GitHub. 18F will develop a schema as part of the service it provides to agencies.

### MyMadison
MyMadison is an open source platform that allows individuals to comment on laws and legislation. With MyMadison, users can access laws as they are being written, leave comments, annotate specific content, and interact with other participants. ** what about this from a schema perspective? **

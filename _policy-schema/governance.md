This section provides information about how we will mature the Policy Schema model over time.  The OFCIO recognizes the need to update the model on a regular basis.  As the Policy Schema becomes more widely used, additional data attributes will be added.  
## Timeline
We will refine the schema on a yearly basis to ensure it stays relevant to government practitioners. The OFCIO will work with experts in the academic, private, and public realm to ensure that this policy schema can be used throughout the government and adopted by anyone seeking to organize and clarify complex policy.

## Maturity Model
We have adopted the Data Governance Maturity Model to manage the evolution of the policy schema over time. The policy schema will mature in the following phases: 
*Initial*- During this phase the OFCIO researches how policy is written and what standards exist in the field. The primary purpose of this initial discovery phase is to understand what policies already exist in the federal sector.

1.  **Managed**- The Managed Phase consists of identifying specific requirements in existing IT policy that is issued by OMB and populating a draft schema. This phase will allow the OFCIO to understand the scope of existing policy and what is needed to organize this information effectively.
2.  **Defined**- During the Defined Phase OFCIO will work to ensure that the policy schema is interoperable with other standards that exist in this space. Ideally, OFCIO will map the Policy Schemaâ€™s attributes to those of schemas that collect data on regulations and legislation. We will also look at how policies from other Federal agencies could be mapped to the schema.
3.  **Quantitatively Managed**- In this phase we will develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure adoption of the schema and how well it addresses business needs.
4.  **Optimized**- Using KPIs established in the Quantitatively Managed phase, OFCIO will work to continually improving the Policy Schema. Optimization will result in a Policy Schema that is:
    * Accurately defining policies; 
    * Useful for agencies; and 
    * Interoperable with other schemas.

Over the past year OFCIO has analyzed IT policies and tagged requirements according to the Policy Schema taxonomies which are detailed [here]( https://policy.cio.gov/taxonomies/).  

Over the next year the OFCIO will work with agency staff and 18F to develop a human centric website that can communicate requirements to the public.  In the meantime, the data collected for this website will be available for download on Policy.CIO.gov.  

The data is currently divided into three phases- Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 is being validated by subject matter experts, and Phase 3 is currently being analyzed.  The OFCIO will post updated datasets as they become available.   

#### Phase 1

## Requirement Tagging and Quality Assurance 

In order pull requirements out of the memos and gather Meta data for the policy schema, OFCIO standardized its analytic approach.  This ensured that the data collected was more uniformed and the requirements were valid.  

Please note that this document is intended to guide analysts and is not an official process.  The OFCIO recommends that users adopt this process to fit the needs of their organization.

### Requirement Tagging Procedure:
In general, mark the policy if there is anything out of placeA  That way the analyst can go back later and check for issues.

1.	Convert the PDF to a Word document if possible.  This will cut down on formatting issues 

2.	Create a excel sheet that contains the policy schema meta data as columns
 
 a.	Each requirement will be a row
 
 b.	There will be a lot of repeated data, but that can be fixed later

3.	In the spreadsheet create “Tags” for types of requirements (see https://policy.cio.gov/taxonomies/ for the categories that were used in this project)

4.	Change the formatting in both documents.

  a.	Calibri, size 11, Left-justified, central

  b.	“Wrap” text helps with legibility from our end (don’t wrap “Link” column)

5.	Read the policy once before pulling out the requirements to understand the structure of the document 

6.	In the document check for impacted agencies to see if any are specified in the opening paragraphs of the memo.

7.	Pull requirements from the policy and input the data to the excel spreadsheet

  a.	Each requirement gets a unique identifier which is the policy’s number, then a dot, then a number assigned to it.  For example if an analyst is working with Policy 52 the first requirement would be 52.01
 
    i.	We are going to moving toward using the URL of the posted policy as the unique identifier.  The URL will also be used in the requirement numbers
  
  b.	Look for key words that indicate that there is a requirement (see https://policy.cio.gov/taxonomies/)
  
  c.	Include the meta data for each requirement 
  
  d.	Check for references 
  
  i.	If the requirement references another document, include it in the “Citation” section
  
    ii.	If the requirement references another requirement include the referenced requirement number in brackets []
  
  e.	If the requirement needs context to be understood include the context in brackets []
  
  f.	Tag the requirement using the predefined tags.  A requirement can have more than one tag.  If the requirement addresses an issue that is not in the predefined tags, include it in the other category.

## Quality Assurance Procedure
Once the analysts are done collecting requirements we start the quality assurance process.  This ensures that the Analysts collected the information correctly and the data is standardized.  Requirement quality assurance is assigned to an analysts that did not do the initial tagging.

1.	Check the columns in the excel spreadsheet: 
  
  a.	Check Policy Title and Issuing Office for any mistakes
  
  b.	For the same columns check for blank cells or if the value is listed as “None” 
  
    i.	If blank or “None” is listed convert to NA

2.	Start going through requirements
 
 a.	First Round (Not reading requirements, just formatting)
 
 i.	Check Header/Sub header
 
 ii.	Change any parenthesis to brackets
 
 iii.	Check any ellipses and likely fill in
 
 iv.	Delete extra spacing
 
 v.	Lines at beginning or end of requirement
 
 vi.	Spaces at end of sentences/lists
 
 vii.	Obvious spelling mistakes
 
 viii.	Note if the requirement looks like there is a missing citation
 
 b.	Second Round (clarify, verb column, split/combine, and general legibility)
 
 i.	Read requirement text, note if it is unclear
 
 ii.	Split requirement if needed and update tags
 
 iii.	Reference back to document to see if the requirement makes sense or should be combined with another requirement 
 
 iv.	Check the “Verb” from the requirement
 
 v.	Double check “Impacted Agencies” and “Citations” by referencing to document
 
 vi.	Use brackets to clarify anything that put the requirement into the appropriate context 
 
 vii.	Check any lists that are grouped as a requirement - make sure the lists match the document and do not have any extra spacing issues
 
 c.	Third Round – If needed review the requirements again

5. Address any concerns or notes that were raised during the previous rounds

6. Check any referenced requirements to ensure that the reference makes sense

7. Check the tags in each requirement 

8. Spellcheck the spreadsheet

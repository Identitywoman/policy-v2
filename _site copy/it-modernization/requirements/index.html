					<p>Consistent with the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)<sup><a href="#myfootnote5">5</a></sup> and OMB Memorandum M-15-14, “Management and Oversight of Information Technology,”<sup><a href="#myfootnote6">6</a></sup> 
 agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) shall leverage the improved authorities, visibility, and role in contracting and budget processes provided to them under FITARA to implement the requirements of this memorandum.  Other senior agency officials, including the Agency Head, Chief Financial Officers, Chief Acquisition Officers, and Chief Human Capital Officers shall support the CIO in the execution of this initiative.</p>

<p>The IT Modernization Initiative will be implemented in four phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Development of updated Enterprise Roadmaps</li>
  <li>Identification and prioritization of systems</li>
  <li>Development of modernization profiles for high-priority systems</li>
  <li>Execution</li>
</ol>

<p>GSA is currently collaborating with selected agencies to refine relevant criteria and templates, and will share best practices and other resources to aid agencies in carrying out this initiative. These materials will be maintained at management.cio.gov.</p>

<p>The requirements of this memorandum shall apply to all CFO Act agencies.<sup><a href="#myfootnote7">7</a></sup>  Other agencies are encouraged to submit prioritized systems information and modernization profiles to OMB as best practices that improve the composition and execution of their IT portfolios.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-development-of-updated-enterprise-roadmap">Phase 1: Development of Updated Enterprise Roadmap</h3>

<p>Agencies are currently required to develop and maintain updated Information Resource Management (IRM) Strategic Plans and Enterprise Roadmaps on a recurring basis.   For FY 2016, OMB streamlined and restructured its Enterprise Roadmap guidance to ensure an appropriate focus on the modernization of agency IT portfolios, including better utilization of shared services and reduction in the proportion of agency IT budgets dedicated to non-provisioned operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) spending.</p>

<p>As part of their annual Enterprise Roadmap submission that were due September 30, 2016, agencies were required to identify opportunities to transfer IT functions to shared services or cloud services and reduce legacy IT spending, as well as provide a sequencing plan for these activities. These updated Enterprise Roadmaps will serve to assist the agency with the identification and prioritization activities described in Phase 2.</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-identification-and-prioritization">Phase 2: Identification and Prioritization</h3>

<h4 id="refinement-of-criteria-and-templates"><em>Refinement of Criteria and Templates</em></h4>

<p>By MM DD, YYYY, based on pilot work GSA performed with selected agencies, OMB will provide (with GSA’s assistance) agencies a full list of criteria to be utilized by agencies in order to uniformly evaluate and prioritize information systems for modernization and a template for the submission of information to OMB on such identified systems. The criteria and template will support the prioritization of the systems based on security risks, operational risks, modernization impact, and execution ability and facilitate uniform comparison of agency information resource management.</p>

<p>A sample minimum list of criteria to be used by agencies to evaluate and prioritize systems for modernization can be found in Appendix A. A sample system information template, to be used by agencies to submit information on priority systems, can be found in Appendix B. Agency CIOs should immediately begin to engage other senior agency officials, including program managers and business process owners, in the evaluation and prioritization of systems for modernization based on the information contained in Appendices A and B.</p>

<p>By MM DD, YYYY, OMB (again, with GSA’s assistance) will publish a template to be used to develop and submit system modernization profiles, as required under Phase 3. A sample modernization profile template can be found in Appendix C.</p>

<h4 id="prioritization-of-it-systems-for-modernization"><em>Prioritization of IT Systems for Modernization</em></h4>

<p>By MM DD, YYYY, all CFO Act agencies will be required to submit to OMB information on each of the agency’s highest priority systems for modernization, using the criteria and system information template described above. Given the unique mission, environment, and long-term modernization goals of each agency, the agency CIO should determine the appropriate weight given to each criterion in evaluating the modernization priority of an individual system within the context of the agency’s updated Enterprise Roadmap. Detailed information must be provided for a minimum of three systems, although agencies are encouraged to include information on additional systems as warranted. As part of this submission, agencies shall include at least one system for which full modernization or retirement, including completion of the replacement system, if applicable, could occur over a 6-12 month timeframe.</p>

<p>Agencies should leverage existing system inventories required under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), systems associated with High Value Assets (HVA) identified through the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) or other high-value data sets listed in agency Enterprise Data Inventories, as well as automated hardware and software continuous monitoring or other asset inventory tools (e.g., Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation), to assist in identifying and prioritizing systems.<sup><a href="#myfootnote9">9</a></sup>  Agencies should also utilize, to the extent permitted by contract, any pre-existing systems inventories, such as stewardship reports, maintained by the agency’s private sector vendors, to help identify agency systems and their current support status. <sup><a href="#myfootnote10">10</a></sup></p>

<p>To fulfill this requirement, the agency CIO is responsible for submitting a completed system information template for each of the agency’s priority systems through an encrypted MAX Collect exercise. Upon receipt of this information, OMB, with the assistance of GSA, will conduct an initial review of each agency’s System Information Templates and determine what, if any, additional information is needed from the agency.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-modernization-profiling">Phase 3: Modernization Profiling</h3>

<p>By MM DD, YYYY, using the modernization profile template refined in Phase 2, all CFO Act agencies are required to submit to OMB a minimum of three modernization profiles (one each for an individual system for which a system information template was previously submitted); however, submission of additional modernization profiles is encouraged. In addition, agencies are permitted to submit joint modernization proposals, provided that a single agency be designed as the lead; joint proposals will count only toward the three-system minimum of the lead agency.</p>

<p>Modernization profiles should demonstrate and explain why the selected system should be prioritized for modernization, retirement, or replacement. Consistent with OMB’s Cloud Computing Strategy, CIOs should consider the use of provisioned services, such as cloud, where possible, in developing agency modernization profiles.<sup><a href="#myfootnote11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>To fulfill this requirement, the agency CIO will be responsible for submitting a completed modernization profile template for each of the agency’s priority systems through a MAX Collect exercise. A sample modernization profile template can be found in Appendix C. Modernization profiles are not to exceed 10 pages each.</p>

<h3 id="phase-4-execution">Phase 4: Execution</h3>

<p>Agencies must plan for continuous modernization. To accomplish such plans, agencies must leverage their Enterprise Roadmaps and system-level modernization profiles to inform their annual budget submissions.</p>

<p>Contingent upon Congressional enactment of the ITMF, funding provided by the ITMF could be used to supplement and accelerate modernization efforts proposed in agency budget submissions and subsequently appropriated by Congress, and would not duplicate funding provided through agencies’ existing budgets.</p>

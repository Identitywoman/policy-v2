<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide implementation guidance for the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148">Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act</a> (FITARA)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and related information technology (IT) management practices.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>FITARA was enacted on December 19, 2014. FITARA outlines specific requirements related to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) Authority Enhancements</li>
  <li>Enhanced Transparency and Improved Risk Management in IT Investments</li>
  <li>Portfolio Review</li>
  <li>Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative</li>
  <li>Expansion of Training and Use of IT Cadres</li>
  <li>Maximizing the Benefit of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative</li>
  <li>Governmentwide Software Purchasing Program</li>
</ol>

<p>To implement the requirements of FITARA, combined with the need to update policy and guidance related to other modern IT practices, OMB is publishing this guidance. This guidance reflects input from a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), Assistant Secretary for Management (ASAM), Chief Operating Officer (COO), and CIO communities.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<p>The objectives of the requirements outlined in this memorandum are to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Assist agencies in establishing management practices that align IT resources with agency missions, goals, programmatic priorities, and statutory requirements;</li>
  <li>Establish governmentwide IT management controls that will meet FITARA requirements while providing agencies with the flexibility to adapt to agency processes and unique mission requirements;</li>
  <li>Establish a “Common Baseline” for roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the agency CIO and the roles and responsibilities of other applicable Senior Agency Officials<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> in managing IT as a strategic resource;</li>
  <li>Enable the CIO’s role, with respect to the development, integration, delivery, and operations of any type of IT, IT service, or information product to enable integration with the capabilities they support wherever IT may affect functions, missions, or operations;</li>
  <li>Strengthen the agency CIO’s accountability for the agency’s IT cost, schedule, performance, and security;</li>
  <li>Strengthen the relationship between agency CIOs and bureau CIOs;</li>
  <li>Establish consistent governmentwide interpretation of FITARA terms and requirements;</li>
  <li>Assist agencies in establishing an inclusive governance process that will enable effective planning, programming, budgeting, and execution for IT resources;</li>
  <li>Provide transparency on IT resources across entire agencies and programs; and</li>
  <li>Provide appropriate visibility and involvement of the agency CIO in the management and oversight of IT resources across the agency to support the successful implementation of cybersecurity policies to prevent interruption or exploitation of program services.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="scope-and-applicability">Scope and Applicability</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Covered agencies: CFO Act agencies<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and their divisions and offices are subject to the requirements outlined in FITARA and this memorandum, except where otherwise noted. The Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community, and portions of other agencies that operate systems related to national security are subject to only certain portions of FITARA, as provided for in the statute, and shall meet with OMB no later than 60 days following the final release of this guidance to clarify the applicability of this guidance throughout their organizations and activities, including alternative requirements or exceptions.</li>
  <li>Additionally, all other Executive Branch agencies are encouraged to apply the principles described in this guidance to their management of IT, consistent with their legal authorities.</li>
  <li>Covered agencies shall implement this guidance in a manner consistent with other legal authorities and should consult with their counsel regarding those authorities.</li>
  <li>With respect to Offices of Inspectors General (OIG), this guidance should be implemented in a manner that does not impact the independence of those offices and the authorities Inspectors General have over the personnel, performance, procurement, and budget of the OIG, as provided in the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. App 3).</li>
  <li>This memorandum builds upon and will refer to existing OMB policy and guidance.</li>
  <li>Where possible, this guidance incorporates agency reporting requirements introduced by FITARA into existing OMB processes, such as PortfolioStat, the Integrated Data Collection (IDC),<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Acquisition Human Capital Planning, and the Federal IT Dashboard (ITDB), rather than creating new reporting channels and tools.</li>
  <li>With respect to Federal statistical agencies and units as defined in the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA),<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> covered agencies under FITARA shall implement this guidance in a manner that ensures that statistical data collected under a pledge of confidentiality solely for statistical purposes are used exclusively for statistical purposes, consistent with CIPSEA.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="section-a-defining-the-scope-of-resources-related-to-information-technology-a-idsection-aa">Section A: Defining the Scope of Resources Related to Information Technology <a id="Section-A"></a></h3>

<p>Many of the requirements of this memorandum refer to the agency CIO’s involvement with the decision processes and policies related to “information technology resources” throughout the agency, including IT within programs. To establish a consistent governmentwide interpretation of the Federal resources included in this scope, the following definition shall be used for “information technology resources.”</p>

<p>“<strong>Information technology resources</strong>” includes all:</p>

<p>A. Agency budgetary resources, personnel, equipment, facilities, or services that are primarily used in the management, operation, acquisition, disposition, and transformation, or other activity related to the lifecycle of information technology;</p>

<p>B. Acquisitions or interagency agreements that include information technology and the services or equipment provided by such acquisitions or interagency agreements; but</p>

<p>C. Does not include grants to third parties which establish or support information technology not operated directly by the Federal Government.</p>

<p>This definition and this memorandum refer to the term <strong>“information technology,”</strong> which for the purposes of this memorandum is defined as:</p>

<p>A. Any services or equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that are used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency; where</p>

<p>B. such services or equipment are ‘used by an agency’ if used by the agency directly or if used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires either use of the services or equipment or requires use of the services or equipment to a significant extent in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.</p>

<p>C. The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including provisioned services such as cloud computing and support services that support any point of the lifecycle of the equipment or service), and related resources.</p>

<p>D. The term “information technology” does not include any equipment that is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract that does not require use of the equipment.</p>

<p>This definition is based on the definition of information technology found in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Additional definitions used in this memorandum are available in <em>Attachment A</em>.</p>

<h4 id="revising-other-it-management-policies-to-reflect-this-scope">Revising other IT management policies to reflect this scope</h4>

<p>To establish consistency across IT management and acquisition policies, OMB Circular A-130, OMB Circular A-11, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will be updated to reflect these definitions of “information technology resources” and “information technology,” as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="section-b-implementation-of-the-common-baseline-a-idsection-ba">Section B: Implementation of the Common Baseline <a id="Section-B"></a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The “Common Baseline” (<em>Attachment A</em>) provides guidance on the CIO’s and other Senior Agency Officials’ roles and responsibilities for the management of IT. This Common Baseline provides a framework for agencies to implement the specific authorities that FITARA provides for CFO Act agency CIOs, and builds upon their responsibilities as outlined in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> The Common Baseline also speaks to the roles and responsibilities of other Senior Agency Officials, as it is critical that these officials in each covered agency are engaged in the oversight of IT investments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All covered agencies shall institute policies and procedures that implement the roles, responsibilities, and requirements found in the Common Baseline. The Common Baseline provides agencies with certain flexibility to adopt procedures that meet these requirements in a manner tailored to the volume and type of work completed by the agencies. As explained further in <em>Attachment A</em>, agencies may adopt a plan that provides for the CIO’s direct involvement or a framework approved by the CIO that contains clear rules on the procedures by which decisions are made and articulates that the CIO remains responsible and accountable for those decisions (referred to as the “CIO Assignment Plan” in <em>Attachment A</em>). Further detail is provided in the “CIO Assignment Plan” section found in <em>Attachment A</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Each agency shall take the following actions to implement the Common Baseline:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complete agency self-assessment and plan.</strong> Each covered agency shall conduct a self-assessment that identifies current conformity with or gaps in conformity with the Common Baseline, and shall articulate an implementation plan describing the changes it will make to ensure that all Common Baseline responsibilities described in <em>Attachment A</em> are implemented by December 31, 2015. This shall include a discussion of how agency senior leaders and program leaders will work in partnership to facilitate the successful implementation of the Common Baseline and how the agency CIO will be enabled as a strategic partner integrated in shaping Agency strategies, budgets, and operations. The deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher is responsible for the completion of the self-assessment and plan documents. This self-assessment and implementation plan shall not exceed 25 pages and shall include the template in <em>Attachment C</em> or another template approved by OMB.</li>
      <li><strong>Submit to OMB for acceptance of self-assessment and implementation plan.</strong> Covered agencies shall submit this self-assessment and this implementation plan for review and approval to OMB’s Office of E-Government &amp; Information Technology (E-Gov) as well as to the agency’s relevant OMB Resource Management Office no later than August 15, 2015. To fulfill this requirement, the agency deputy secretary or chief operating officer or higher is responsible for submitting these documents by email to egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line: “[Agency Abbreviation] FITARA Common Baseline Implementation Plan.” OMB may request additional information from agencies before the self-assessment and implementation plan are approved. Agencies shall post the “implementation plan” portion of this document (posting the “self-assessment” is optional but encouraged) on their public website at agency.gov/digitalstrategy, and include it as a downloadable dataset in their Public Data Listing<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>, no more than 30 days following OMB acceptance and thereafter keep the public document up to date with access to a history of previous versions.</li>
      <li><strong>Support ongoing oversight of implementation plan and Common Baseline.</strong> Covered agencies shall follow OMB guidance from PortfolioStat sessions and other oversight activities regarding the ongoing implementation of the Common Baseline. Agencies shall notify OMB of any obstacles or incomplete implementation of the Common Baseline on an ongoing basis following the initial implementation deadline. OMB may request agencies to revise or update agency self-assessments or implementation plans during implementation as more information becomes available about the agency’s management processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Conduct annual review and update to self-assessment.</strong> Covered agencies shall update the self-assessment annually to identify any obstacles or incomplete implementation of Common Baseline responsibilities that occurred over the preceding 12 months. The first update will be due April 30, 2016, and each April 30 on an annual basis thereafter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The following additional actions will be taken to support agencies’ implementation of the Common Baseline:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Federal CIO Council (the Council) shall develop and share on-going support and tools.</strong> Through the end of fiscal year (FY) 2016, the Council will dedicate time in its meetings to discuss current topics related to the implementation of the Common Baseline at least once every quarter. The Council should consult with the CFO Council in the development of materials to support changes related to the Common Baseline across management domains. The Council will also assist agencies in implementing the Common Baseline by sharing examples of agency governance processes and IT policies on a public website at <a href="https://management.cio.gov">https://management.cio.gov</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Support President’s Management Council (PMC) follow-up.</strong> By June 30, 2015, the PMC will select three members from the Council to provide an update on governmentwide implementation of FITARA on a quarterly basis through the end of FY2016. These updates will improve each agency’s awareness of policies and processes which have worked well at other agencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="section-c-transparency-risk-management-portfolio-review-and-reporting-a-idsection-ca">Section C: Transparency, Risk Management, Portfolio Review, and Reporting <a id="Section-C"></a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Covered agencies shall continue to report required data to OMB as part of the quarterly IDC, per current instructions . OMB will continue to update IDC instructions posted on the MAX Federal Community on a quarterly basis<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Standardized cost savings metrics and performance indicators.</strong> As a part of the IDC reporting requirements, agencies shall continue to provide cost savings and cost avoidance achieved as a result of strategies that the agency has decided to adopt. Based on this information, agencies will be provided a summary scorecard that provides agency-specific performance metric data and portfolio analysis agenda items.</li>
      <li><strong>Sharing with the public and Congress.</strong> As required by the Consolidated Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 and (P.L. 113-235)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>, OMB will continue to report quarterly to Congress on the cost savings, avoidance, and reductions in duplicative IT investments resulting from the above agency efforts. OMB will also provide a summary of these savings by agency on a publicly accessible website. Agency reporting requirements for these topics are included in the IDC instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Covered agencies shall continue to provide information to the ITDB, as required by OMB’s capital planning and investment control (CPIC) guidance, which is issued annually in conjunction with the release of OMB Circular A-11<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>.  As a part of that guidance, the following approaches will be used to meet FITARA requirements:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monthly reporting.</strong> Covered agencies shall continue to provide updates of risks, performance metrics, project, and activity data for major IT investments to the ITDB as soon as the data becomes available, or at least once each calendar month.</li>
      <li><strong>Data improvement program.</strong> If OMB or the agency CIO determines data reported to the ITDB is not timely and reliable, the CIO (in consultation with the agency head) must notify OMB through the IDC and establish within 30 days of this determination an improvement program to address the deficiencies. The CIO will collaborate with OMB to develop a plan that includes root cause analysis, timeline to resolve, and lessons learned. In addition, the CIO will communicate to OMB the steps the agency is taking to execute the data improvement program and the progress the agency is making. Agencies will provide updates on the status of this program on a quarterly basis as a part of their IDC submission until the identified deficiency is resolved.</li>
      <li><strong>TechStat Sessions.</strong> A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review of an IT program with agency leadership<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>.  TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. For all agency-led TechStat reviews of investments, the agency shall contact egov@omb.eop.gov with the subject line, “[Agency Acronym] TechStat Notification,” at least two weeks ahead of the TechStat session. Agencies shall follow the agency’s TechStat policy and procedures based on the CIO.gov TechStat Toolkit when managing TechStat sessions. Agencies shall report the outcomes and outputs of all TechStat sessions through the quarterly IDC, including: the assessment described in <em>Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework</em>, a root cause analysis of performance issues, corrective action plans which address these causes, and a timeline for implementing the corrective actions. More detailed reporting guidance will be provided in the quarterly IDC instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>High risk rating.</strong> Given the size and complexity of the multi-billion dollar Federal IT Portfolio, it is critical to maintain a focus on the health of IT investments across the government. As required by CPIC guidance, the CIO evaluations reported to the ITDB for all major IT investments must reflect the CIO’s assessment of the current level of risk for any major investment’s ability to accomplish its goals based on factors described in the CPIC guidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic TechStats.</strong> Moreover, if an investment has a high risk rating (red CIO evaluation in the ITDB) for three consecutive months beginning July 1, 2015, agencies must hold a TechStat session on that investment. The session must be held within 30 days of the completion of the third month. If this investment remains categorized with a red CIO evaluation one year following the TechStat session then OMB may take appropriate performance and/or budgetary actions until the agency has addressed the root cause and ensured the investment’s ability to complete the remaining activities within planned cost and schedule.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As explained in Attachment D, PortfolioStat is a data-driven tool that agencies use to assess the current maturity of their IT portfolio management processes and select PortfolioStat action items to strengthen their IT portfolio. Covered agencies shall hold PortfolioStat sessions on a quarterly basis with OMB, the agency CIO, and other attendees. (These sessions were previously annual and required the attendance of the agency deputy secretary (see <em>Implementing PortfolioStat</em> (M-12-10)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>, <em>Fiscal Year 2013 PortfolioStat Guidance: Strengthening Federal IT Portfolio Management</em> (M-13-09))<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>, and <em>Fiscal Year 2014 PortfolioStat</em> (M-14-08))<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>

<p>During these sessions, agencies will<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>:
     * Discuss and update a multi-year strategy to identify and reduce duplication and waste within the IT portfolio of the agency, including component-level investments and to identify projected cost savings resulting from such strategy;
     * Identify or develop ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the IT investments of the agency;
     * Identify or develop opportunities to increase the use of shared-service delivery models;
     * Identify potential duplication and waste;
     * Develop plans for actions to optimize the IT portfolio, programs, and resources of the agency;
     * Review investments included in High Impact Programs; and
     * Develop ways to better align the IT portfolio, programs, and financial resources of the agency to long term mission requirements or strategic plans required by law.</p>

<p>Agencies must report the status of PortfolioStat action items in the IDC at least quarterly. Annually by April 30, agency heads shall review and certify the status of PortfolioStat action items with the agency CIO and send to OMB.<br />
  OMB will focus on the metrics highlighted in PortfolioStat materials, data submitted through the quarterly IDC process, and agency IT Major Business Case information developed through the CPIC process to assess agency PortfolioStat progress.

  <li>
    <p>IT Acquisition Cadres. FITARA’s requirements for IT acquisition cadres builds upon OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) July 2011 memorandum on building specialized IT acquisition cadres<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>. As originally required by the memorandum, <em>Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan for Civilian Agencies – FY 2010 – 2014</em><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">91</a></sup> of October 27, 2009, civilian CFO Act agencies shall continue to send their annual <em>Acquisition Human Capital Plans</em> to OMB OFPP. The latest iteration of those Plans was due April 15, 2015. Additional guidance from OMB issued in February 2015 requires agencies to address new reporting elements required by FITARA. Details regarding these new reporting elements are found in <em>Attachment F</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Category Management and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI)<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>. Agencies will be required to comply with an upcoming new rule regarding purchases of services and supplies of types offered under an FSSI agreement without using an FSSI agreement. In February 2015, the FAR Council initiated rulemaking to implement this provision of FITARA, which creates a preference for strategically sourced vehicles. Once finalized, agencies will be required to include in the contract file a brief analysis of the comparative value, including price and non-price factors, between the services and supplies offered under the FSSI and services and supplies offered under the source or sources used for the purchase. This rule will be in addition to other strategies that OFPP is developing around category management, a practice adopted by industry where spending is managed by categories of common spending, like IT and Transportation, and led by experts who promote governmentwide best practices and help agencies avoid unnecessary duplicative spending and activities. OMB formally launched the Category Management initiative<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> in December 2014.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Governmentwide Software Purchasing Program. The General Services Administration (GSA), in collaboration with OMB, shall create, and allow agencies access to, governmentwide enterprise software licenses through new awards as part of category management. These awards shall, at a minimum, allow for the purchase of a license agreement that is available for use by all Executive agencies<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup>.</p>

<p>All covered agencies shall adopt specific controls for the management of IT from the “Common Baseline” below.  The Common Baseline prescribes a basic set of specific responsibilities and processes that all covered agencies shall have in place no later than December 31, 2015. A set of definitions follows the Common Baseline to further clarify the specific responsibilities.</p>

<p>Throughout the Common Baseline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All references to “CIO” refer to department/headquarters CIOs, and only references to “bureau CIO” refer to the CIO or official-with-CIO-duties within a bureau or any component organization of the agency (see definitions).</li>
  <li>If an agency has a “budget officer” separate from the CFO, then references to “CFO” shall also refer to the budget officer.</li>
  <li>If an agency has a “senior procurement executive” separate from the CAO, then references to “CAO” shall also refer to the senior procurement executive.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DOD, the Intelligence Community, and portions of other agencies that operate systems related to national security are subject to only certain portions of FITARA and shall meet with OMB no later than 60 days following the final release of this guidance to clarify the applicability of this guidance throughout their organizations and activities, including alternative requirements or exceptions.</p>

<h4 id="common-baseline-cio-assignment-plan">Common Baseline CIO Assignment Plan</h4>

<p>It is critical that the agency CIO retain accountability for the roles and responsibilities identified in the Common Baseline. As agency environments vary considerably, CIOs may find that decisions about some IT resources included in the Common Baseline may be more appropriately executed by other agency officials, such as a bureau CIO or even parts of program or procurement communities. This must be done in a way to allow the agency CIO to retain accountability.</p>

<p>For the responsibilities other than those detailed in D1 and M1 of the above chart (budget approval and bureau CIO appointment), the CIO may designate other agency officials to act as a representative of the CIO in aspects of the above processes in a rules-based manner, such as by a dollar threshold, type of planned IT activity, or by bureau. This designation shall be developed in consultation with the CFO, CAO, CHCO, and other Senior Agency Officials, as appropriate. Even if a representative is substituted for the CIO, the CIO retains accountability for the assigned role or responsibility and thus must ensure the overall suitability of selected officials.  Because the selected official represents the CIO, CIOs should monitor the ongoing suitability of this designation and revise as appropriate.  This allows the CIO to define a rules-based manner to select representatives such members of the CIO’s office, or a bureau CIO, to represent the CIO for portions of the Common Baseline responsibilities described above (such as for contract review of purchases of less than a certain dollar threshold).</p>

<p>Agencies which plan to use such a rules-based method must describe it in a “CIO Assignment Plan” (Plan) and submit it for OMB approval as detailed in Section B above. Plans must show evidence that the CIO retains accountability for the designated alternative agency officials’ involvement and decisions and that the appropriate level of rigor shall be executed by this official in place of the CIO. The agency shall post the Plan publicly at agency.gov/digitalstrategy and include it as a downloadable dataset in the agency’s Public Data Listing not more than 30 days following the Plan’s approval by OMB.</p>

<p>Related statutory language from FITARA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“A covered agency… may use the governance processes of the agency to approve such a contract or other agreement if the Chief Information Officer of the agency is included as a full participant in the governance processes.” Also, “[t]he head of each agency shall ensure that the Chief Information Officer of the agency has a significant role in… the decision processes for all annual and multi-year planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions, related reporting requirements, and reports related to IT and …the management, governance and oversight processes related to [IT].” 40 U.S.C. § 11319(b)(1)(A) and (C)(i)(III)</li>

<h2 id="attachment-d-fiscal-year-fy-2015-portfoliostat-a-idattachment-da">Attachment D: Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 PortfolioStat <a id="Attachment-D"></a></h2>

<p>This Attachment describes changes to the PortfolioStat process used in FY 2015, including reporting requirements for agencies. This attachment also describes the goals and topics which agencies and OMB will address through the FY2015 PortfolioStat process.</p>

<p>PortfolioStat<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> was established in FY 2012 to assess the maturity of Federal IT portfolio management, consolidate and eliminate duplicative spending on Commodity IT,<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> and improve agency processes to drive mission and customer-focused IT solutions. PortfolioStat is an evidence-based, data-driven review of agency IT portfolio management with agency leadership that continues to drive significant cost savings and efficiencies. To date, agencies have saved over $2.59 billion,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> exceeding the $2.5 billion in savings opportunities identified in the original FY 2012 PortfolioStat sessions.</p>

<p>Each year this process has evolved to better align Federal IT policy goals to agency IT portfolios. As part of this evolution, starting in FY 2015 we have changed PortfolioStat from being an annual review session to quarterly reviews. OMB now collects agency progress data on a quarterly basis<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> and as such has an obligation to provide timely performance feedback throughout the year. Sharing this feedback quarterly will better allow OMB to track progress and recommend course corrections more frequently.</p>

<p>In alignment with the Administration’s core IT objectives, PortfolioStat sessions will focus on three key areas: (1) driving value in Federal IT investments, (2) delivering world-class digital services, and (3) protecting Federal IT assets and information. Prior to each quarterly PortfolioStat session, agencies will be provided a scorecard including agency-specific performance metric data (see Fiscal Year 2015 PortfolioStat Performance Metrics below for specific metrics) and portfolio analysis agenda items.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The agenda of PortfolioStat sessions between OMB and agencies will focus on the following initiatives:</li>
</ol>

<p>– <strong>PortfolioStat Action Items.</strong> Agencies will discuss the status of each PortfolioStat action item reported through the IDC with OMB.</p>

<p>– <strong>High Impact Programs.</strong> Agencies will use Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework to describe the strategy, progress, critical milestones, risk, and expected impact of investments included in High Impact Programs. OMB will continue to work with agencies to designate investments included in High Impact Programs.</p>

<p>– <strong>Agency Digital Service Teams and United States Digital Service (USDS).</strong> OMB will review the agency’s progress in laying the organizational groundwork and establishing Digital Service Teams, the agency’s plan for effectively leveraging those resources, and the status of the performance of USDS activities.</p>

<p>– <strong>Commodity IT.</strong> Agencies will discuss how they use category management<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> to consolidate commodity IT assets, eliminate duplication between assets, and improve procurement and management of hardware, software, network, and telecom services. Furthermore, agencies will share lessons-learned related to commodity IT procurement policies and efforts to establish enterprise-wide inventories of related information.</p>

<p>– <strong>IT Management Roles and Responsibilities.</strong> Agencies will discuss the status of their plans to implement the Common Baseline (Attachment A) and monitor the effectiveness of the CIO’s execution of the included roles and responsibilities. This should include discussion of the CIO’s relationship with other Senior Agency Officials, as well as those officials’ execution of listed roles and responsibilities.</p>

<p>– <strong>Portfolio Management Maturity.</strong> Agencies will use the categories described in Attachment E: Investment and Portfolio Management Maturity Framework to evaluate the maturity of the agency’s People, Technology, Governance, Process, and Acquisition capabilities related to IT resources. Agencies should describe how their policies implement the portfolio management, capital planning, and other processes required in OMB Circular A-130, OMB Circular A-11’s capital planning and investment control guidance, and other OMB IT management policies, including this guidance. For example, agencies should describe how agency priority goals, agency strategic objectives, the IT investment portfolio, the Information Resource Management (IRM) Strategic Plan, and the Enterprise Roadmap relate to each other and support the efficient and effective accomplishment of agency program and business objectives. Finally, agencies should describe how they select the system development lifecycle frameworks used in IT development activities, such as the use of incremental development and modular approaches prioritized by customer requirements.</p>

<p>– <strong>Data Center, Cloud, and Shared Services Optimization.</strong> Agencies will discuss their progress using cloud computing and shared services to optimize data center activities and achieve overall IT objectives. This includes a discussion of how the agency is using FedRAMP services and ensuring cloud services meet applicable FISMA requirements.</p>

<p>– <strong>Cybersecurity.</strong> In addition to the “Protect” metrics in Fiscal Year 2015 PortfolioStat Performance Metrics below, PortfolioStat discussions will draw on topics covered in each agency’s quarterly Cybersecurity Self-Assessments.</p>

<p>– <strong>World-Class Customer Service.</strong> Agencies shall discuss how their portfolio management practices emphasize the customer-centric themes of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook,<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> OMB’s capital planning and investment control guidance<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup>, and the Smarter IT Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup>. Agencies should describe where in their policies the following are implemented: the Playbook’s “Understand what people need” play, the capital planning guidance requirement for major investments to measure customer satisfaction performance metrics, and the Smarter IT CAP Goal’s focus on improving outcomes and customer satisfaction with Federal services.</p>

<p>– <strong>Open Data.</strong> Experts have calculated that the potential economic benefits of open data are in the trillions of dollars<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup>.  The Federal government has made significant strides in opening up data to drive economic growth. Currently there are over 117,000 data sets available on data.gov <a href="www.data.gov">http://www.data.gov/</a>. As a next step, agencies should improve the quality and types of datasets. Agencies should continue to evaluate their enterprise data inventory, conduct outreach to understand the users of their data, improve customer feedback mechanisms, and release datasets—subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions.</p>

<p>– <strong>Streamlining reporting.</strong> OMB will continue to seek opportunities to reduce agency burden through revising reporting requirements and improving reporting channels through the ITDB and IDC as well as work with agencies to develop opportunities to improve the timeliness and reliability of reported ITDB data.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quarterly PortfolioStat activities will take place in three phases: (1) Preparation; (2) Session; and (3) Post-Session. The following provides details on each phase with guidance on the schedule and requirements to ensure PortfolioStat is consistently implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>– <strong>Phase 1: Preparation.</strong> Following each quarterly agency IDC submission, OMB will analyze the latest data, consider trends in performance metrics over time, and review past PortfolioStat topics and PortfolioStat action items to identify topics for the upcoming PortfolioStat session’s discussion. OMB will send these topics, analysis, and proposed agenda for each agency to the agency’s PortfolioStat lead. Agencies are encouraged to work closely with OMB to provide clarifications and improvements to the preparation prior to the quarterly PortfolioStat session.</p>

<p>– <strong>Phase 2: Session.</strong> Agency PortfolioStat leads shall work with OMB to schedule a PortfolioStat session to be held within eight weeks following the relevant IDC quarter’s submission deadline. In the session, OMB and the agency CIO will review updates to the agency’s Strategic IRM Plan and Enterprise Roadmap, trending data from the agency’s IDC and IT Dashboard submissions, discuss preceding quarterly PortfolioStat action items, status of investments included in High Impact Program(s), and select performance metrics. Based on the discussion, OMB and the agency will identify and agree on PortfolioStat action items (with specific deadlines) which OMB will send to the agency within two weeks of the completed session. Where appropriate, results from these sessions shall be integrated into agency budget submissions and Congressional Budget Justifications.</p>

<p>– <strong>Phase 3: Post-Session.</strong> Upon receipt of PortfolioStat action items, agency PortfolioStat leads shall work with OMB to include updates on the status of these items in the next quarterly PortfolioStat. Agencies that do not meet a deadline identified in a PortfolioStat action item shall brief the Federal CIO and the agency head at least once per quarter until the action item is complete. Agencies shall describe progress implementing each PortfolioStat action item as a part of quarterly IDC reporting. At least once per year, agency heads shall review with the agency CIO and certify that the reported status of each PortfolioStat action item is accurate and send this certification to OMB.</p>

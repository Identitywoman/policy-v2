					<h3 id="iv-implementation">IV. Implementation</h3>

<p>As agencies take steps to meet the requirements in this Memorandum, it is important to work strategically and prioritize those elements that can be addressed immediately, support mission-critical objectives, and result in more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p>Agencies should consider the following as they implement the requirements of this Memorandum:</p>

<h4 id="roles-and-responsibilities">1. Roles and Responsibilities</h4>

<p>The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 assigns agency CIOs statutory responsibility for promoting the effective and efficient design and operation of all major IRM processes within their agency. Accordingly, agency heads must ensure that CIOs are positioned with the responsibility and authority to implement the requirements of this Memorandum in coordination with the agency’s Chief Acquisition Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Senior Agency Official for Geospatial Information, Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Senior Agency Official for Records Management, and Chief Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Officer. The CIO should also work with the agency’s public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners and other leadership, as applicable.</p>

<p>A key component of agencies’ management of information resources involves working closely with the agency’s SAOP and other relevant officials to ensure that each stage of the planning process includes a full analysis of privacy, confidentiality, and security issues. Agency heads must also ensure that privacy and security officials are positioned with the authority to identify information that may require additional protection and agency activities that may require additional safeguards. Consistent with OMB Memorandum M-05-08, <sup id="fnr39"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup> each agency’s SAOP must take on a central planning and policy-making role in all agency information management activities, beginning at the earliest stages of planning and continuing throughout the life cycle of the information. In addition, if an agency’s SAOP is not positioned within the office of the CIO, the agency should designate an official within the office of the CIO to serve as a liaison to help coordinate with the agency’s privacy office.</p>

<h4 id="government-wide-coordination">2. Government-wide Coordination</h4>

<p>The Federal CIO will work with the United States Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and the Administrator of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to help improve the interoperability and openness of government information. To this end, the Federal CIO will work to establish an inter-agency working group supported by the Federal CIO Council. The working group should focus on leveraging government-wide communities of practice to help with the development of tools that support information interoperability and openness through repositories such as Project Open Data. Part of this work should be to share best practices related to interoperability and openness within government (e.g., Federal, state, local, and tribal). These collaborations shall be subject to statutory limitations and conducted in a way that fully protects privacy, confidentiality, confidential business information, and intellectual property rights.</p>

<h4 id="resources">3. Resources</h4>

<p>Policy implementation may require upfront investments depending on the maturity of existing information life cycle management processes at individual agencies. Agencies are encouraged to evaluate current processes and identify implementation opportunities that may result in more efficient use of taxpayer dollars. However, effective implementation should result in downstream cost savings for the enterprise through increased interoperability and accessibility of the agency’s information resources. Therefore, these potential upfront investments should be considered in the context of their future benefits and be funded appropriately through the agency’s capital planning and budget processes. Some of the requirements in this Memorandum may require additional tools and resources. Agencies should make progress commensurate with available tools and resources.</p>

<p>In addition, tools, best practices, and schema to help agencies implement the requirements of this Memorandum can be found through the Digital Services Innovation Center and in Project Open Data.</p>

<h4 id="accountability-mechanisms">4. Accountability Mechanisms</h4>

<p>Progress on agency implementation of the actions required in this Memorandum will be primarily assessed by OMB and the public through analysis of the agency’s updates to IRM plans (part III, section 5), the completeness of the enterprise data inventory (part III, section 3.a.), and the data made available in the agency’s public data listing (part III, section 3.b.).</p>

<p>Nothing in this Memorandum shall be construed to affect existing requirements for review and clearance of pre-decisional information by OMB relating to legislative, budgetary, administrative, and regulatory materials. Moreover, nothing in this Memorandum shall be construed to reduce the protection of information whose release would threaten national security, invade personal privacy, breach confidentiality or contractual terms, violate the Trade Secrets Act, <sup id="fnr40"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup> violate other statutory confidentiality requirements, <sup id="fnr41"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> or damage other compelling interests. This Memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

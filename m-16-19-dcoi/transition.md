## Development Freeze for New and Current Data Centers

Beginning 180 days after issuance of this memorandum, agencies may not budget any funds or resources toward initiating a new data center or significantly expanding<sup>[9](#myfootnote1)</sup> an existing data center without approval from OMB OFCIO.<sup>[10](#10)</sup>  To request such approval, agencies must submit a written justification that includes an analysis of alternatives (including opportunities for cloud services, inter-agency shared services, and third party co-location) and an explanation of the net reduction in the agency’s data center inventory that will be facilitated by the new or expanded data center (such as through consolidation of multiple existing data centers into a single new data center).

## Consolidation and Closure of Existing Data Centers

As previously required by the FDCCI, agencies shall continue to principally reduce application, system, and database inventories to essential enterprise levels by increasing the use of virtualization to enable pooling of storage, network and computer resources, and dynamic allocation on-demand.  Thereafter, agencies shall evaluate options for the consolidation and closure of existing data centers,<sup>[11](11)</sup> by (in order of priority):

1.	Transitioning to provisioned services, including configurable and flexible technology such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to the furthest extent practicable, consistent with the Cloud First policy.<sup>[12]<sup>
2.	Migrating to inter-agency shared services or co-location data centers.
3.	Migrating to more optimized data centers within the agency’s data center inventory.

## Cloud Investment

Cloud environments are scalable and allow agencies to provision resources as required, on-demand.<sup>[13]<sup> Consistent with the Cloud First policy, agencies shall use cloud infrastructure where possible when planning new mission or support applications or consolidating existing applications. Agencies should take into consideration cost, security requirements, and application needs when evaluating cloud environments. As required by FITARA, agencies utilizing cloud services shall do so in a manner that is consistent with requirements of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.<sup>[14]<sup>

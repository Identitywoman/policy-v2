## MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

## FROM:	Tony Scott- Federal Chief Information Officer 

## SUBJECT:	Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)

### August 1, 2016

Background

In 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) launched the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to promote the use of green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware, software, and operations; increase the overall IT security posture of the Federal Government; and shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

In December 2014, the President signed into law the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA),<sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup> which enacts and builds upon the requirements of the FDCCI.  FITARA requires that agencies submit annual reports that are to include: comprehensive data center inventories, multi-year strategies to consolidate and optimize data centers, performance metrics and a timeline for agency activities, and yearly calculations of investment and cost savings.
<br>
In addition, FITARA requires the Administrator of the Office of E-Government and Information Technology (henceforth referred to as the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO)<sup>[3](#myfootnote1)</sup>) to establish and publish cost savings and optimization improvements, provide public updates on cumulative cost savings and optimization improvements, and review agencies’ data center inventories and the implementation of data center management strategies.
<br>
This memorandum defines a framework for achieving the data center consolidation and optimization requirements of FITARA, the criteria for successful agency data center strategies, and the metrics OMB OFCIO will use to evaluate the success of those strategies

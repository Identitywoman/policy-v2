The OFCIO is developing a “Policy Schema” to organize public policy based on the principles of a database schema. 
Database schemas are traditionally used to represents logical views of information within databases. These database schemas define how data is organized and enable its efficient retrieval. They also provide constraints, defining what types of data are included, and how data is named. The OFCIO’s Policy Schema will serve an analogous purpose. 

The Policy Schema will create a structure the government can use to organize policies and create “buckets” for related information. The schema will provide clarity and ease of use for agencies, government practitioners, and the public, making requirements and guidance contained within policies easier to access. Instead of reading through or manually searching for relevant requirements in a 900-page document, the Policy Schema will enable users to pull those requirements with a single click. Additionally, once this structure is created, the OFCIO will be able map agency requirements across policy, legislation, and regulations 

The Policy Schema is the backbone of two major OFCIO projects to reform IT policy across the federal sector.  In order to understand the existing policies, the OFCIO set out to map and standardize Office of Management and Budget’s IT Policy.  Creating a common baseline is essential to understand what reforms were needed.  

Extensive research was conducted in order to create the draft Policy Schema. The OFCIO researched schemas that were being crafted in the legislative, regulatory, and academic sectors. A list of related projects is available here. Experts in government data were also consulted and their insights were incorporated into the Schema.

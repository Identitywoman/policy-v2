# Welcome
## Federal Chief Information Officer’s Policy Schema Website

The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer is working to create a model to organize and structure policy based on the principles of a database schema. We are calling this model the “Policy Schema.” 

The Policy Schema will be used to ensure that requirements and best practices contained within policies are accessible and clear. The Policy Schema will also be used to inform the policy drafting process and information about policies upon publication.  

As the Policy Schema is developed, we invite you to provide feedback and comments on the model. For more information on the Policy Schema please visit our background page here. 

The content of this site is organized to facilitate ongoing discussions on how to organize policy data.  See below for a brief description of each site section:
* Background on Schema
  * This section provides general information about the Policy Schema and how it relates to ongoing efforts to reform OMB policies.
* Related Projects and Interoperability 
  * In this section we discuss the efforts of other organizations in this field which we referenced during the drafting of the Policy Schema.  You can find links to federal, state, private and academic projects that influenced our thinking.
  *This section also discusses our long-term ambition to build out the schema to map to other data schemas.  This is a long-term goal, and we will be updating this content regularly. 
* Schema Glossary  
  * The schema is really a set of attributes to describe data organized into a hierarchy.  You can view the definitions of the attributes that are included in the Policy Schema in this section.  
* Governance 
  * This section describes the governance process the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) will use to ensure that the Policy Schema stays relevant and incorporates feedback into its design.  Through a defined maturity model, we will continuously improve the model and iterate on its design.
* Example of Policy
  * vIndividuals familiar with data schemas may find it useful to view the Policy Schema applied in an XML format.  This section provides an example of a populated schema in XML.
* Questions and Contact Information
  * This section provides instructions on how to contact us, provide feedback, and get involved in the Policy Schema project.

IV.	Introduction
The mission of the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Information Technology Category (ITC) Services is to aid, accelerate and improve the government-wide use of outsourcing and consulting technology modernization and optimization efforts by leading with innovation and leveraging the buying power of the Federal government for this sub-category.

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of efforts by the Executive Office of the President and Federal Departments and Agencies to improve the Government’s cybersecurity posture. This RFI seeks industry input on modernizing and securing email infrastructure while simultaneously improving collaboration capabilities within and across Federal Departments and Agencies to dramatically enhance the ability of Federal Government employees, contractors and other stakeholders to work together.  

Currently, GSA offers IT cloud e-mail and collaboration services to federal, state, local and tribal governments through the Schedule 70 cloud Special Item Number (SIN) 132-40. The goal of these offerings is to provide agencies procurement contracts with broadly accepted cost and time savings to increase government efficiency through the adoption of cloud computing technologies. These acquisition contracts provide value by reducing acquisition time, cost, and risk, allowing GSA customers to focus on their mission.  Additionally, cloud and email services are available for acquisition directly via GWACs and on Networx, as well as through NASA and HHS GWACs.

GSA is seeking information about alternative models and/or solutions for potential future acquisition contracts that further these goals consistent with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy’s Category Management focus. Consequently, all sources are invited to submit information, comments, feedback and recommendations for potential development and implementation of a new acquisition vehicle and corresponding business model for acquiring cloud email and collaboration tool IT services that can be leveraged by agencies planning to migrate to the cloud and agencies that have already deployed cloud solutions.

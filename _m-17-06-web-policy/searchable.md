Search functions are now a universal and expected website feature the public commonly uses to find information. Furthermore, search engine optimization is critical to reaching users who primarily rely on commercial search engines to find information. 

**A**. Agenciesâ€™ public websites must contain a search function that allows users to easily search content intended for public use. GSA maintains a search solution that meets this requirement and that is available to all agencies at [http://search.digitalgov.gov](http://search.digitalgov.gov).

**B**. Agencies must ensure that all content intended for public use on their website can be indexed and searched by commonly used commercial search engines.

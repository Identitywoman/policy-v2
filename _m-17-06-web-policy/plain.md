Web content is most effective when it is easy to understand, find, and use. The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires agencies to draft all public-facing web and print documents in plain writing, calling for agency writing to be clear, concise, and well-organized. <sup>[33](#myfootnote14)</sup>  On April 13, 2011, OMB issued [Memorandum, M-11-15, Final Guidance on Implementing the Plain Writing Act of 2010.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-15.pdf) 

As required by law and OMB guidance, agencies must ensure that web content is written in a manner suitable for the intended audience. The Federal Plain Language Guidelines and other resources maintained by the interagency Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) at [www.plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/) can assist agencies in meeting the goals of the Plain Writing Act.

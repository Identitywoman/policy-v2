Laws, regulations, or other policies will occasionally mandate that agencies place certain links on their website. Agencies must respect and adhere to these statutory or executive-level mandates and incorporate these requirements in a manner that does not reduce the usability or performance of the agency’s website and digital services.

At a minimum, agencies must post links to the following information on the agency’s principal website and on any known sub-agency or other major entry points to their site:

**A.**	USA.gov;

**B.**	the website’s privacy policy;

**C.**	the agency’s Freedom of Information Act webpage;

**D.**	a page about the agency with descriptions of the agency organization structure, mission, and statutory authority, and links to the following information.<sup>[35](#myfootnote14)</sup>  

1.	the agency’s strategic plan and annual performance plans;
2.	the agency’s Privacy Program Page;
3.	the agency point of contact as required by the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002;<sup>[36](#myfootnote36)</sup>   
4.	the agency’s Open Government Page;
5.	the agency’s Plain Writing Page;  <sup>[36](#myfootnote14)</sup> 
6.	information as required under the No Fear Act of 2002;<sup>[38](#myfootnote14)</sup>   and 
7.	information associated with the agency’s implementation of the Information Quality Act. <sup>[39](#myfootnote39)</sup>  

For other required links, Federal agencies should determine the best location on their website to place those links based on user needs and the underlying requirement from law or policy.

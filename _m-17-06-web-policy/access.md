Government information and services should be readily available to the public regardless of device. Agencies must, to the extent practicable, ensure that their public websites and digital services perform equally well on non-desktop devices such as mobile devices and tablets. 

**A**.	For new websites and major website redesigns, agencies must ensure responsive design that allows users on non-desktop devices equivalent access to Government information.  <sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup>

**B**.	When determining how to optimize legacy websites and digital services for mobile and other devices, agencies must use customer feedback and analytics to prioritize modernization of the sites and services that are most frequently accessed by users.

#### *Footnotes*
<a name="myfootnote1">13</a>: Responsive design usually refers to website design that automatically adjusts navigation and content presentation to best fit the device (e.g., mobile phone or desktop monitor) on which the content is viewed.

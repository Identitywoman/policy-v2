All Federal records on agency websites and third-party sites and applications must be properly managed. At a minimum, agencies must be able to identify, retrieve, and preserve Federal Agency records created and maintained on agency websites or third-party sites. These requirements apply until their business use has ended and the records are transferred to NARA or destroyed according to their disposition schedule. Agencies must also manage administrative records that provide evidence of how of their web and third-party programs are managed and operated. Agencies using third-party websites or services are responsible for managing and capturing Federal records created or received on those sites. 

Agencies are required to comply with all Federal records management laws, regulations, and policies. Additional guidance for agencies on meeting their records management responsibilities can be found at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/.

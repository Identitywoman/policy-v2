title: 2. Use Analytics and User Feedback to Manage Websites and Digital Services 
permalink: /web-policy/analytics

---

All public facing websites and digital services should be designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions. Agencies should use qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test websites and digital services to ensure that user needs are addressed. 

   **A**. All agencies must participate in the General Service Administrationâ€™s (GSA) Digital Analytics Program [DAP](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) and deploy the DAP tracking code on all public facing agency websites. The DAP provides agencies with free quantitative analytics to inform website management. Participation in the DAP does not preclude agencies from using other analytics programs. 

  **B**. GSA will maintain a public listing of the domains participating in the DAP and track agency compliance on the DotGov Dashboard. 

  **C**. Agency use of web measurement and customization technologies must comply with OMB Memorandum M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies. <sup>[7](#myfootnote7)</sup>    

  **D**. Agencies can often use the [Fast Track](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-26.pdf) clearance process <sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup> under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for the collection of service delivery feedback.  In particular, the Fast Track process allows agencies to gather timely feedback from users through the following types of voluntary information collections:
* Focus groups; 
* One-time or panel discussion groups;
* Customer satisfaction qualitative surveys;
* Post-transaction customer surveys;
* Online surveys;
* Comment cards or complaint forms;
* Moderated, unmoderated, in-person, and remote usability studies; and
* Testing of a survey or other collection to refine questions. 

**E**. OMB has issued additional guidance, [Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/SocialMediaGuidance_04072010.pdf), and [Flexibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act for Compliance with Information Collection Requirements](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/pra_flexibilities_memo_7_22_16_finalI.pdf), to clarify the PRA with respect to its existing flexibilities and various types of social media and collaborative technologies that can further help agencies get feedback from users. <sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>

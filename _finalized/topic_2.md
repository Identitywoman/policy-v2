<p>Some content about this site.</p>

<h3 class="usa-heading">Subhead Interesting</h3>

<p>The UI components are built on a solid <strong>HTML</strong> foundation, progressively enhanced to provide core experiences across browsers. All users get critical information and experiences. New browsers get the prettiest experiences, while older browsers get less pretty, but usable ones. If JavaScript fails, users will still get a robust HTML foundation.</p>

<h4>Even less interesting</h4>

<h4>One more thing</h4>

<p>The standards are designed to support both older and newer browsers through progressive enhancement, and officially support Internet Explorer 9 and up, and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Internet Explorer 8 and below generally see very low usage today, and most agency websites should be able to safely begin support at Internet Explorer 9.</p>

<h4>About the visual style guide</h4>
<p>While many programs maintain their own unique brand identities, this guide offers a single common visual style which can be flexibly applied to a broad range of government digital platforms. The Visual Style Guide on this site offers a <strong>clean, modern aesthetic</strong> that meets <strong>high standards of visual accessibility</strong> while promoting a sense of <strong>credibility, trust, and warmth</strong> in the design.</p>
<p>The color palette and typography were selected to provide both consistency and flexibility. The combination of a sturdy serif and slender sans serif with brighter hues can create a contemporary look and feel. When used alongside softer colors, different font pairings from the set will communicate a more classic and traditional aesthetic. The typography meets a range of layout needs; from polished marketing pages to content-heavy digital services. The palette’s blue, white, and red can be applied generously or sparingly, all in attempt to create a distinctly American design with adaptability baked in.</p>
<p>We fully expect many teams will need to customize this style guide, but we encourage you to incorporate as much consistency in look, feel and usability as possible.</p>
<p>As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/">18F’s Content Guide</a> when writing language for government services.</p>

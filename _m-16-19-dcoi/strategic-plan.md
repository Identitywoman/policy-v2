Agencies are required to publish their Strategic Plans at *[agency].gov/digitalstrategy* under a section entitled, “Data Center Optimization Initiative Strategic Plans,” within 60 days of the issuance of this memorandum.  Subsequent Strategic Plan updates shall be due on April 14, 2017 and April 13, 2018.
